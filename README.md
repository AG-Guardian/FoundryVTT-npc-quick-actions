# Illandril's NPC Quick Actions (5e)

This is a module for Foundry Virtual Tabletop that adds a "Quick Actions" list above the Token HUD for NPCs. This list shows all Features and Spells for the NPC that has an Activation Cost, and indicates how many uses the NPC has for items with limited uses.

For NPCs with features with an "Action Recharge" that are not currently charged, or Legendary Actions where the available Legendary Actions is less than the maximum, a special "Reset Actions" quick action is also provided. Clicking this special action resets the NPC's available Legendary Actions to the maximum, and rolls each rechargeable action to see if it is recharged.

This currently only supports the DnD5e System.
